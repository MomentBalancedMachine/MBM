# Moment Balanced Machine (MBM)
Moment Balanced Machine (MBM): A New Supervised Inference Engine for Regression problem

MBM model extends the SVM concept to consider the moments in determining the optimal moment hyperplane, and Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) is employed to obtain the weight of each case used in the MBM model
